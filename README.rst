This is a small project for using !OpenSceneGraph with the !RaspberryPi. It does not (currently) implement a fully-fledged osgViewer::!GraphicsWindow object; it simply uses the !EmbeddedWindow API.

Also included is the script I use to cross-compile OSG applications using CMake for the !RaspberryPi, since building OSG itself ON the Pi would probably take longer than just rewriting a new scenegraph yourself. :)

You can find a prebuilt version of !OpenScenGraph-3.1.4 in the downloads section if you want to get an example up and running quickly.

*If you are interested in funding further refinement of OSG support on the !RaspberryPi and Broadcom !VideoCore device, please contact [http://alphapixel.com AlphaPixel]!* This could be a really interesting, emerging market for dirt-cheap OpenGL/OSG visualization...
